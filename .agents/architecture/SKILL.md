## Dependency Direction
```
adapter/in → port/in → service → port/out → adapter/out
```

- `adapter/in` depends on `port/in`
- `service` implements `port/in`, depends on `port/out`
- `adapter/out` implements `port/out`
- `domain` has no dependencies on any layer

## Layer Rules

### domain/
- Pure Kotlin class. No JPA annotations, no Spring annotations.
- Must not know about JPA, Redis, or any infrastructure.

### application/port/in/
- UseCase interface. Defines what the application can do.
- Called by `adapter/in`.

### application/port/out/
- Persistence port interface. Defines what the application needs from outside.
- Called by `service`. Implemented by `adapter/out`.

### application/service/
- Implements UseCase. Contains business logic.
- Only knows `port/out` interface — never knows JPA directly.
- `@Transactional` goes here.

### adapter/in/
- GraphQL controller (`@MutationMapping`, `@QueryMapping`).
- Calls UseCase only. No business logic here.

### adapter/out/persistence/
- Implements persistence port.
- Knows JPA. Handles `{Domain}JpaEntity` ↔ `{Domain}` conversion via extension functions.
```kotlin
fun {Domain}JpaEntity.toDomain() = {Domain}(...)
fun {Domain}.toEntity() = {Domain}JpaEntity(...)
```

### global/
- Cross-cutting concerns: config, security, common exceptions.

## Naming Rules

| Layer | Naming |
|-------|--------|
| UseCase | `Fetch{Domain}UseCase`, `Append{Domain}UseCase` |
| PersistencePort | `{Domain}PersistencePort` |
| Service | `Fetch{Domain}Service`, `Modify{Domain}Service` |
| WebAdapter | `{Domain}WebAdapter` |
| PersistenceAdapter | `{Domain}PersistenceAdapter` |
| JpaEntity | `{Domain}JpaEntity` |
| JpaRepository | `{Domain}JpaRepository` |
